// What an exit's proceeds columns mean. ONE definition, read everywhere.
//
// On a `proceeds` row:
//   proceeds_received  GROSS proceeds realized at the exit — everything the fund is owed for what it
//                      sold, INCLUDING any part the buyer held back in escrow. This is what the form
//                      labels "Proceeds (gross)" and what the tracker, MOIC, DPI and realized gain read.
//   proceeds_escrow    The portion of that gross still held back. A disclosure, never an extra amount:
//                      it is never added to proceeds_received.
//
// So the cash that arrived at the exit is gross − escrow, the rest is a receivable (1350), and the
// realized gain is gross − basis. When the escrow lands, an `escrow_receipt` row (its own
// proceeds_received = the amount released) moves it from 1350 to cash and adds no proceeds.
//
// Before this was pinned down, the ledger and several reports read proceeds_received as the cash
// received and added the escrow on top, so a gross figure entered on the form booked the escrow
// twice. Rows recorded before then may hold either reading; scripts/diagnose-escrow-exits.ts lists
// them for review.
