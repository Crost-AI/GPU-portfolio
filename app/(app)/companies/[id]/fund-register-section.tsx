/**
 * A fund holding's register on its own page: terms, calls and distributions received, NAV
 * statements. The register is kept per (holding, entity), so a fund two of the viewer's entities
 * committed to shows one entity at a time — it opens on the one a link named (`?entity=`) when the
 * viewer has it, and FundHoldingDetail's own entity picker switches between them. No remount on a
 * switch: the detail syncs its `vehicleId` and drops a stale response itself (latest-only.ts).
 *
 * Its Add menu is the page's one Add for a fund holding: notices and NAV statements open its own
 * dialogs, and "Other transaction" opens the investments section's generic form (`onAddTransaction`).
