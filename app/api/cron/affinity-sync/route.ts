 * Affinity sync scheduler. Runs hourly and enqueues an `affinity_sync` job for

 *

 * which already handles claiming, retries, stale-job reaping, and the function
 * time budget. Doing the network work here would duplicate all of that and risk
 * a long fan-out blowing the cron's ceiling.
 *
 * Auth: same `Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}` pattern as the other crons.
